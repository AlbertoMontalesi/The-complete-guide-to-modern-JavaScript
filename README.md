## About me

My name is Alberto Montalesi, I am from Italy and I am working in Vietnam as a Software Developer creating enterprise software.

My passion for programming started late in life, in 2016 at the age of 24 after a bachelor's degree in Law.

My path to become a self-taught software developer has not been easy, but it's definitely something I would do again.

You can read my story on Medium at this link: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/my-journey-from-esl-teacher-to-software-developer-35cc998a6ec0

Writing a book that can help other aspiring developers fills me with pride as I know very well how hard it can be to find the motivation and the resources to continue studying and improving your skill.

Apart from programming, my other passions include photography, traveling and gaming.
