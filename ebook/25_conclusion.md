# Conclusion

I sincerely thank you for making it this far. This is my first book and knowing that somebody read it all fills me with joy.

I hope that you found it useful and if that is the case I suggest you to follow my new [website](https://www.inspiredwebdev.com/) and my [DevTo](https://dev.to/albertomontalesi) where I write articles about Web Development.

Thank you very much for your time and your support.

A special thanks to all the users on GitHub that made pull requests and opened issues to help fix mistakes and improve the quality of the book.
