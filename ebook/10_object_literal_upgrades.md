# Chapter 10: object literal upgrades

In this chapter we'll look at the many upgrades brought by ES6 to the **object literal** notation.

## Deconstructing variables into keys and values

This is our initial situation:

```javascript
const name = "Alberto";
const surname = "Montalesi";
const age = 25;
const nationality = "Italian";
```

Now if we wanted to create an object literal this is what we would usually do:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: name,
  surname: surname,
  age: age,
  nationality: nationality,
};

console.log(person);
// { name: 'Alberto',
// surname: 'Montalesi',
// age: 25,
// nationality: 'Italian' }
```

In ES6 we can simplify like this:

```javascript
const person = {
  name,
  surname,
  age,
  nationality,
};
console.log(person);
// {name: "Alberto", surname: "Montalesi", age: 25, nationality: "Italian"}
```

As our `const` are named the same way as the properties we are using, we can reduce our typing.

## Add functions to our Objects

Let's look at an example from ES5:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alberto",
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello");
  },
};

person.greet();
// Hello
```

If we wanted to add a function to our object, we had to use the `function` keyword. In ES6 it got easier, look here:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alberto",
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  },
};

person.greet();
// Hello;
```

No more `function`, itâ€™s shorter and it behaves the same way.

**Remember** that **arrow functions** are anonymous, look at this example:

```javascript
// this won't work, you need a key to access the function
const person1 = {
  () => console.log("Hello"),
};

const person2 = {
  greet: () => console.log("Hello"),
}
person2.greet()
// Hello
```

&nbsp;

## Dynamically define properties of an object

This is how we would dynamically define properties of an object in ES5:

```javascript
var name = "myname";
// create empty object
var person = {};
// update the object
person[name] = "Alberto";
console.log(person.myname);
// Alberto
```

In the example given above, first we created the object and then we modified it. However, in ES6 we can do both things at the same time. Take a look at the following example:

```javascript
const name = "myname";
const person = {
  [name]: "Alberto",
};
console.log(person.name);
// Alberto
```
